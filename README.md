### Course Description

This graduate seminar approaches literature as a *social practice*—a network of relations among
writers, editors, institutions, technologies, and readers. Drawing from literary studies,
sociology, and anthropology, we trace the life cycle of the literary work: from the writer’s
workshop and the archive, through the institutions that publish, circulate, and preserve it, to
the interpretive communities and fan cultures that sustain it.

Core readings pair theoretical frameworks (Bourdieu, Becker, Williams) with empirical
ethnographies and case studies (Childress, Radway, Jenkins). The course concludes by examining
co‑authorship and conspiracy as collective forms of storytelling that test the limits of
individual authorship and belief.

### Course Requirements & Grading

Students will read approximately the equivalent of three scholarly articles per week, attend
weekly seminars, contribute to discussion (in person and online), and develop an independent
research project culminating in a final paper.

Grade breakdown:

```
- Class participation ................................................. 25%
- Weekly response forum ............................................... 25%
- Midterm essay (6–8 pp.). ............................................ 20%
- Final research project (15–20 pp.) .................................. 30%
```

**COI note on workload & feedback:** Weekly pages are calibrated to ~100–120 pp. (heavier weeks are offset in adjacent weeks). A substantial **mid‑semester** assignment (the Midterm Essay) ensures timely feedback. Where a **book** appears below, it is assigned as **_selections from_**.

### University Policies

**Academic integrity.** When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism undermines our collective work. See
Columbia’s guidelines at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity>. We will also
discuss the appropriate use of AI tools.

**Accessibility.** Students requesting accommodations should contact the Office of Disability
Services and inform the instructor within the first two weeks.

**Attendance.** Graduate seminars depend on steady presence; two unexcused absences may affect
the final grade.

**Inclusive learning.** We maintain a respectful, collaborative environment. Please alert the
instructor early to any barriers to participation.
